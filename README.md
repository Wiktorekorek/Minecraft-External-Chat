This application lets you access your Minecraft chat in a separate, customizable window â€” perfect for a second monitor setup.

âœ¨ Features:
View and interact with chat messages outside the game
Scrollable chat history with extended message limit (beyond Minecraftâ€™s default)
Easily search messages and copy them
Adjust window size and font size freely
Keep seeing chat messages even when in-game chat is hidden (by setting in-game chat font size to 0)

Ideal for streamers, multitaskers, or anyone who wants a more flexible Minecraft chat experience.
